# Fabless-Bio Studio Interface

An interactive demonstration of the Fabless-Bio platform architecture for tissue engineering. This browser-based mockup visualizes how the **Detailed Development Strategies Phase** could function, specifically demonstrating tissue design.

## What This Is

This is a **conceptual demonstration**, not production software. It illustrates how fabless-bio designers could specify tissue geometry, generating foundry-agnostic design files that specialized tissue foundries translate into manufacturing instructions. No installation required - it's a client-side HTML interface that runs directly in your browser. Open the file and explore the concept.

## The Fabless-Bio Vision

The Fabless-Bio model adapts semiconductor industry architecture to tissue engineering, separating design from manufacturing through five phases:

1. **Concept and Design** - Cell source selection and bioprocess planning
2. **Modeling and Simulation** - Virtual prototyping and computational validation  
3. **Detailed Development Strategies** - Translation into manufacturable specifications
4. **Verification and Validation** - Design integrity checks and feasibility assessment
5. **Manufacturing Handoff** - Foundry-agnostic Bio-DL files converted via foundry-specific Bio-PDKs


## Why This Matters

Traditional tissue engineering conflates design and manufacturing - you can't design a bioprinted tissue without knowing the specific printer, bioink rheology, and nozzle parameters. The Fabless-Bio model separates these concerns:

**Designers** specify biological requirements and geometric intent through standardized formats (Bio-DL).

**Foundries** translate these specifications using their Biofabrication Process Design Kits (Bio-PDK), which define their specific equipment capabilities, material libraries, resolution limits, and validated protocols.

This demonstration shows how fabless-bio design could work within that framework.

## Intended Audience

This demonstration helps tissue engineers, foundry operators, investors, and regulators visualize how fabless biofabrication could separate design innovation from manufacturing specialization - mirroring how the semiconductor industry scaled through division of labor rather than vertical integration.

## Current Status

**This is a conceptual mockup, not validated production software.** It demonstrates interaction patterns and workflow concepts for the proposed Fabless-Bio platform architecture described in the manuscript.
